* typin'
** TODO

** Ideas

- later skill: words are related to other nearby words, highlihted and can start typing them to teleport
- Gain a supply of "forward-word/ backward word/ sentence etc" shortcuts. Emacs/vim binds as powerups.

  ** Other  PRototyep:
  - might work better as a dungeon crawler than a platformer... but how does the typing work if you are, say, in a corridor:
this is the level
a    x
boop of the thing
... maybe like, top down and the words are paths, can choose the forks

*** Dum rando
- tying rhythm game section.
- typing of the dead section.
- flappy bird typing tutor section
- marquee text as moving platforms

** aesthetic
